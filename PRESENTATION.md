# VIBE Portal - Presentation & Demo Scripts

## 1. Master Script (Narrative)

**Introduction:**
"Welcome to the VIBE Portal, the central nervous system for our educational institution. This platform bridges the gap between administration, teaching staff, and students, providing a unified interface for managing the entire educational lifecycle."

**Part 1: The Foundation (Administrator)**
"We start with the Administrator view. The Admin is the architect of the system.
*   **User Management:** Here we see a complete list of all users. The Admin can create new accounts, assign roles (Student, Teacher, Staff), and manage permissions.
*   **System Health:** The Admin also has direct access to the database via Prisma Studio to ensure data integrity."

**Part 2: The Organizer (Staff)**
"Next, we switch to the Staff role – our organizational backbone.
*   **Education Tracks:** Staff members define the academic calendar. Here we create a new 'Fachinformatiker 2024' track.
*   **Course Planning:** Within that track, we schedule specific courses like 'Web Development', assigning them to rooms and time slots."

**Part 3: The Educator (Teacher)**
"Now, let's see the Teacher's perspective.
*   **My Courses:** Teachers see a dashboard of their active modules.
*   **Exam Management:** A critical feature. The teacher creates a new exam for next Friday.
*   **Grading:** Once the exam is done, the teacher enters grades directly into the system, which are immediately visible to students."

**Part 4: The Learner (Student)**
"Finally, the Student view – the most used interface.
*   **Dashboard:** Upon login, the student sees their upcoming schedule and announcements.
*   **Time Tracking:** A vital compliance feature. The student clicks 'Clock In' to start their day, logging their attendance for the employment agency.
*   **Inquiries:** If a student has a problem, they don't send a loose email. They use the 'New Inquiry' button to send a structured ticket directly to the relevant department."

**Conclusion:**
"The VIBE Portal replaces fragmented spreadsheets and emails with a single, role-aware application, streamlining operations for everyone involved."
